# 🌇 UrbanEnergyGrid: Self-Sustaining City Power

**Replace nuclear/fossil fuels with:**  
✔️ Skyscraper solar mirrors  
✔️ EV batteries as grid storage (V2G)  
✔️ Sand heat batteries  
✔️ Laser steam turbines

*How it works:  
1. Sunlight → Mirrors → Indoor PV  
2. Excess energy → Sand batteries/V2G  
3. Lasers supplement steam turbines*
